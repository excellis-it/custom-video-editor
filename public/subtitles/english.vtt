00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.010
(intro music) If you are mine, these

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.270
winds of yours are yours. If you are mine,
all ways are yours.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.270
If you are mine, I am yours. If you are
mine, these lights of yours are yours.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.860
If you are mine, hearts

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.330
surrender to you. If you are

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.970
mine, I am yours. You are the revolution
of love for the restless one.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.310
My world is a dream in your arms. It has
become deeper.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.450
The color of love has become deeper. It
has become deeper.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.450
Your memory has become deeper. Yours has
become so.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.450
If you are mine, this wind of yours is
yours. If you are mine,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.870
all ways are yours. If you are mine, I am
yours. The sky twinks with eyelashes.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.190
You are the life of millions of angels.
They ask where do you stay?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
Tell them to stay in my arms. The sky
twinks with eyelashes.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
Where has he seen you too? There is glow
where you are.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
To stay in my arms, this is the only
prayer. If you are mine,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
this wind of yours is yours. If you are
mine, all ways are yours.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
If you are mine, I am yours. You are the
revolution of love for the restless one.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.190
My world is a dream in your arms. It has
become deeper.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.440
The color of love has become deeper. You
are the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.350
only

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.510
one who has

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:56.080
become

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:08.100
you.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.060
If

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.940
you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:28.320
are

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:50.860
mine,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.960
then

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.240
your

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.560
God

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.440
is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:57.470
yours.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.829
If

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.740
you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.740
are

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:31.940
mine,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.370
your

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.042
companion is yours. If you are mine, I am
yours.
